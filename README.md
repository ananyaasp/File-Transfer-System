# File-Transfer-System
This project is a GUI-based file transfer application built using Python sockets and Tkinter. It enables authenticated users to connect to a server, view a list of available files, and download them through a clean, user-friendly interface. The system uses chunking, sending files in 8KB segments, which allows efficient memory usage and smooth handling of large files. A login system validates user credentials before granting access, and downloads are displayed with real-time progress indicators. The client ensures unique filenames to prevent overwrites, and the server handles commands like listing files, downloading, and graceful disconnection. This setup provides a robust and responsive foundation for secure file transfers in a local network.
